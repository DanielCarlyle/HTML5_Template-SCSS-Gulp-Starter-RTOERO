                                December 1966, the interim STO/ERO committee presented a brief to Ontario
                                Minister of Education William Davis, requesting a recalculation of teacher
                                pensions. Two days later, Davis announced that minimum pensions would be raised
                                to $1,200.

                                Teachers’ Federation in Toronto. The voting delegates were representatives of

                                newsletter was distributed in November 1968. It was a doubled-sided
                                sheet.<br><br> In December 1968, a committee was established to organize STO/ERO
                                into geographic areas across Ontario, based on the provincial county board
                                system. That resulted in 10 areas, which grew to 12 in 1970. In 1972, the
                                province was reorganized into 21 subdivisions, which would be known as
                                districts. The senate created the districts, which would each have at least
                                three executive members.<br><br> Between 1968 and 1969, STO/ERO met with
                                Minister of Education William Davis seven times to discuss increasing the teachers’
                                pensions.
